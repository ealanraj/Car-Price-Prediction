# Car Price Prediction Dataset

ðŸš— Welcome to the Car Price Prediction dataset repository! ðŸš™

## Overview

The price of a car is influenced by various factors, including the brand's goodwill, car features, horsepower, mileage, and more. This dataset is designed for training machine learning models to predict car prices based on these features.

## Features

- **Brand Goodwill**: Reputation and goodwill of the car brand.
- **Car Features**: Detailed specifications and features of the car.
- **Horsepower**: The power generated by the car's engine.
- **Mileage**: The distance the car can travel per unit of fuel.

## Task

Car price prediction is a challenging and exciting research area in machine learning. This dataset provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning how to train a car price prediction model.

## Usage

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify relevant features and preprocess the data.
3. **Model Training**: Implement machine learning models to predict car prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune as needed.
